# My Personal Project: Digital Planner

## Task 2: Project Proposal  

**Project Purpose:** For my project this term, I would like to create a planner  where you can view and edit your schedule for the upcoming
week or month. This planner will let you visualize your schedule as well as let you add, edit, and delete 
upcoming events. 

**Who Will Use This:**
 - Students who want to visualize their schedules
 - Club executives who want to log their meeting dates 
 - Anyone who wants to be more organized in regards to their personal schedule

**Personal Interest:**

I am interested in this project because every year at the start of the term, I usually
 buy a physical planner to keep track of upcoming assignment deadlines and meetings. A digital version of this planner
would save me the money of buying a new planner each year, as well as reduce the waste from these physical planners.
